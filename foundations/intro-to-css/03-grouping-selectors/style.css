/* 
Did some mistake here, I used syntax for chaining selector instead of group selector
.first.seconde is wrong. I need to differentiate both selector properly
For grouping, existing classes that share same "style" can be grouped together but mostly they 
are very distinct, so we don't repeat same line of code for all the classes.
While chaining is for element(class) that have 2 class, meaning that they mostly use the 
same style but have 2nd class that can be use to make some tweaks for each of them
